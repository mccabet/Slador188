# Slador188 - The Intel 80188 single board computer

This repository holds all the source code and other resources used in my **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SladorSoft)** series where I build a 16-bit Intel 80188 single board computer.

You can find the source code used in the videos in the **src** directory and the schematics in **schematics**.
They have been created with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/). Please note, that I have been using **version 7**, so the schematics may not be down-compatible with the older versions of KiCad.
There are also PDF versions of each of the schematics included.
